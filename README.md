BulkSynchronousParallel-akka
====

This project is part of my work for MSc Thesis in Computer Science.

This is a basic implementation of the Bulk Synchronous Parallel algorithm modeled above the actors as concurrency management model.
It takes advantage of Akka features and simplicity to be run easily in a cluster.
